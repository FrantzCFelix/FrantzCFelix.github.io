            <p>
                Hi there, my name is Frantz Felix. I'm glad you found my page! I'm originally from NJ and
                moved to Seattle just over a year ago. I have been reconnecting with family, making new friends, and
                going on new adventures! I got interested in tech at a young age, primarily from playing video games as
                a kid ! The way everything was rendered seemed like magic and I had to be apart of that magic. I first
                learned a little bit of BASIC in middle school for a “show and tell” then didn’t really jumpstart my
                coding experience until my freshman year of college where I learned C at IUPUI! Unfortunately Indian
                didn’t treat me too well, so I went back to NJ and learned C++ at Burlington County College and then
                transferred to Rutgers-Camden where I continued using C,
                being introduced to the linux operating system, taking other various Computer Science classes and even
                getting my Minor in animation!
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not at my computer I enjoy getting outdoors music festivals, hiking, backpacking, and camping
                are my go-tos! I also enjoy indoor bouldering, I have only been doing it for a year but have gotten
                rather good at it! If i'm not being active I’m hanging out with friends, 3D modeling, 3D printing, or
                playing video games! I am currently addicted to
                Super Smash Brothers! Thanks for taking the time to visit my page and read my bio. I hope you like what
                you see!

            </p>
